This is a test usage of CIgen:

	The example is that of the water molecule in 6-31g basis set. 
	The wavefunction given is the CISD one.

	please run the script proc.sh

	contains: 
	-proc.sh 	: bash script that run CIgen
	-dets_cisd   	: Slater Determinants in spin up, spin down form from Quantum Package (QP)
	-coefs_cisd  	: the associated coefficients from QP diagonalization
	-n_det_cisd	: number of determinants in QP wavefunction
	-input.nml 	: parameters read by CIgen
	-ref/		: directory that contains the output reference files from proc.sh
